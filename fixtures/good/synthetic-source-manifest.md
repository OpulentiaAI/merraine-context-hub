# Synthetic source manifest example

This file shows the **shape** of a source manifest. Every value is synthetic.

The authoritative, populated manifest is private and never enters this
repository. This example exists so the schema is readable and testable without
shipping real account data.

Three rows, deliberately covering the three states that matter:

- **`example-a`** — fully read, and honest about what it still does not cover.
  One source being complete says nothing about the others.
- **`example-b`** — partial: 28 entities available, 6 captured, token expired.
  Note `authorization: past-use`, not `live`: having used a source before is
  history, not current permission. It carries a `suppressionSurface: yes`, so
  its unread suppression rows are named as a gap rather than assumed empty.
- **`example-c`** — registered but unreachable. `unavailable` with a verbatim
  blocker, not an empty result.

# How completeness is read

`completeness` is derived from page contiguity, never from a file being present.
A `ready` artifact is not evidence of completeness, and one extracted source is
never evidence that the account is covered. See
`docs/completeness-and-source-coverage.md`.
